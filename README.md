### Comparing Mistral and Llama for Email Signature Extraction

This project involves evaluating the performance of Mistral and Llama in extracting email signatures and structuring them into JSON format.

#### Steps:

1. **Develop Test Cases**  
   Create a set of test cases to assess each model.

2. **Generate Initial Prompt**  
   Develop an initial prompt to guide the models in extracting email signatures.

3. **Evaluate Prompt on Test Cases**  
   Run the test cases using the initial prompt and analyze the results.

4. **Iterate on Prompt**  
   Refine the prompt through multiple iterations until optimal performance is achieved.
